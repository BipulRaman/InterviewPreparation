### Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Questions

1. What constitutes a class?What is an object?
2. What is the use of abstraction?Explain with a sample code.  
3. What is the difference between abstract and base class? When would you choose a base class over abstract class and vice-versa?
4. What are virtual methods and abstract methods?
5. What is encapsulation?Explain auto-implemented properties and what role do they play in encapsulation?
6. What is polymorphism?What is the difference between method overloading, method overriding and shadowing?Create objects and showcase each technique.
7. What is Inheritance?What are different levels or types of inheritance?What inheritances helps us to achieve?
8. Why would you assign a base class reference to derived class object?
9. Why is it not possible to assign a derived class reference to base class object?
10. When to use a static keyword? What is the use of static class?Static vs Abstract class.
11. Explain the difference between “AS A”, “IS A” and “HAS A” relationships?
12. Explain SOLID Principles with code examples. Mention scenarios when they are useful. How these principles help to write scalable, reusable and cleaner code?
13. What is an interface?Why interface do not have access modifiers?Difference between Abstract class and interface?
14. How interface improves separation of concerns and loose coupling between modules?
15. What do you understand by “Increase Cohesion, Decrease coupling” in Software Architecture Design?
16.	Explain Dependency Inversion Principle?Explain with code example.  
17.	What are constructors?When would you create a Private constructor?
18.	How constructors are used to pass parameters in Inheritance?
19.	Explain Singleton Design Pattern?What is the use of Singleton class?
20.	What is exception handling?(Try, Catch, Finally) Order/Sequence in catching exception.
21.	What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
22.	What is the difference between value and reference type?Is string an entirely reference type?
23.	What are access modifiers?Explain Public, Protected, Private, Internal, Protected Internal.
24.	Explain following keywords and their use in C# with code samples.
    1.	Sealed 
    2.	Static 
    3.	Const 
    4.	Read Only 
25.	Difference between Const and Read Only. When would you choose one over other?
26.	Class Child: Class Parent (Child class inherits parent class). Which statement is correct and why?i. Child C = new Parent (); ii. Parent P = new Child ();
